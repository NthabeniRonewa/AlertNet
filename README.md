# AlertNet
AlertNet is a mobile and web app designed to combat human trafficking. It enables victims or witnesses to report cases anonymously, send SOS alerts with location sharing, and connect directly with NGOs and hotlines. The app also provides educational resources in multiple South African languages to help people identify trafficking risks and protect themselves.
